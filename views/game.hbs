    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <span class="details">
    Reveal the entire board as quickly as possible while hitting as few mines as possible. You'll be racing against the other players to uncover tiles for points. As you uncover a tile, it will tell you how many mines are adjacent to it. If you identify a location you think has a mine, you can place a flag there with a right click, or shift click to mark it. Be careful, other players may place false flags to distract you!

    <span class="details">
    Right click, or shift-click to place a flag.<br/>
    To clear a flag, right/shift click it again.
